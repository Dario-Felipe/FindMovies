This project was made for my learn using ReactJS and API Rest's requisitions. Therefore was used ReactJS, Axios framework and to end IMDB's API Rest with movies that will be requested. This project's interface is very intuitive, only search the film what you want. And if you wanna see more details about that choosed film, go to the option.

--------------- !Important ---------------

Dears, for a some reason one the Google Chrome no accept the requisition by API without Https, so please try access the application by others navigator.
